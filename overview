Requirements:
1) amortisation free: Producing x outputs for an algorithm is x times expensive.
2) steep time-space trade-off
3) bandwidth hard in case of parallel implementation: communication in parallel computations causes bottleneck
4) computationally hard (time)
5) memory hard (space)

These requirements are hard to satisfy simultaneously. The k-XOR problem o the generalised-birthday problem satisfies these properties and the tradeoff can be manipulated by tweaking k.
